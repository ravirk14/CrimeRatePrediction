# CrimeRatePrediction

This is a web application which can predict the crime rate in near future using Random Forest Classifier.

## ❓Problem Statement - Urban and Rural Development

Sustainable urban and rural development is about improving the quality of life in a locality, including ecological, cultural, political, institutional, social and economic components without leaving any burden.

Crime inflicts pain and suffering which lowers the quality of life, thus it is a social problem. Further crimes like theft, money laundering, etc. can affect the economy in the upcoming future hence can be considered as an economic problem. Hate crimes is one of the reasons for cultural problems.

## 💡Solution

One of the ways to solve the above mentioned problem is to keep a check on the crime rates. Prediction of crime rate helps in obtaining trends and patterns over the time period. These help in the preparation to have a better response to criminal activities, eventually preventing crimes therefore reducing crime rate.

## Dataset

We have used the [Indore Police dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yashraut/indore-police-crime-dataset) from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) which is a dataset including 6 types of crimes , timestamps and latitude and longitude to locate places. The dataset consists of 2096 entries.
